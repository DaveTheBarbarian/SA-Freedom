<h2>What we need</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Images and videos we can use in an ad campaign.  Quality, factual stuff meant to get the general public enraged at the situation</li>
    <li>Info from experienced ad campaign managers, social media advertisers, youtube advertisers etc.
  </ul>
<h3>We need money to help the people of South Africa</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal stories work best.  We need a long list of personal stories of actual SA citizens going to be affected by this legislation.</li>
    <li>Using these stories, we can set up gofundme's, youcare's and other fundraising operations to bring in the doe</li>
    <li>This money can be used to fund our ad campaign, with the surplus being donated directly to SA citizens</li>
  
  
</ul>

<h2>Q and A</h2>

**What's the best way I can help?** <br>
Investing time or money.  My main goal for this is for the majority of the right wing and centrist populations of the UK, AU, and USA aware of the situation, willing to spend their money and time to help restore sanity to this situation.  First step on here is to check out /strat/edu to educate yourself.  Second step would be to tell your friends, family and anyone who will listen about what's going on.  If you're willing, check /strat/fund/ for places to donate to SA families in need and our ad campaigns.  Another great way you can help is posting meme dumps in /meme/ or, for the design inclined, ad media and proposals in /ads/* and /ads/proposals respectively. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media pages will be going up throughout our campaign so throw them some likes and support.  Details on the can be found in /strat/social.  

**I want to donate to the cause. Where do I go?** <br>
 A list of validated places you can donate will be listed in [strat/fund/index/list.txt](strat/fund/index/list.txt), with each having a full info file in [strat/fund/index](strat/fund/index).
 
 **I want to start some GoFundMe's or YouCare's to raise money for a specific aspect of the cause.  What do I do?** <br>
Just go make one!  Submit it a file with all the information required in [/strat/fund/submit/SUBMISSIONS.md](/strat/fund/submit/SUBMISSIONS.md) to [strat/fund/submits](strat/fund/submits).  If it checks out I'll throw it over to [strat/fund/index](strat/fund/index)!  I want 90%+ of this money to go to the people of SA.  That being said, we need to get the world's eyeballs on this ASAP.  That means ad campaigns, news coverage and such. I propose that each gofundme we start set aside 10% of what it raises to get more eyeballs on this through buying coverage.  This money should be set aside and allocated to proposals in /ads/proposals.  
 
 **I want to make an ad proposal. What do I put in it?** <br>
 Great! Make your proposal in [ads/props](ads/props).  The more detailed the better.  We'll figure out voting schema for this once this shit gets going.  Linking to media that you've already posted in [ads/](ads/) is helpful as it will help visualize what you're proposing.
